## Docker Stack

Stack is a group of interrelated services that share dependencies and can be orchestrated and scaled together. A single stack is capable of defining and coordinating the functionality of an entire application. And there could be complex application which might have multiple stacks as well.

Docker Stack uses Compose's YAML format and complements the swarm-specific properties for service deployments.

Now we will build stack from dockerfile to compose to docker swarm to docker stack.

Below is the docker image of which will run web server based on flask.
```
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:2.7-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

And our python file ```app.py``` will be below:
```
from flask import Flask
from redis import Redis, RedisError
import os
import socket

# Connect to Redis
redis = Redis(host="redis", db=0, socket_connect_timeout=2, socket_timeout=2)

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    try:
        visits = redis.incr("counter")
    except RedisError:
        visits = "<i>cannot connect to Redis, counter disabled</i>"

    html = "<h3>Hello {name}!</h3>" \
           "<b>Hostname:</b> {hostname}<br/>" \
           "<b>Visits:</b> {visits}"
    return html.format(name=os.getenv("NAME", "world"), hostname=socket.gethostname(), visits=visits)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```
The requirements file will be like below:
```
Flask
Redis
```
And the docker-compose file looks like below:
```
version: "3"
services:
  # Service Name Defined as web
  web:
    # Pull the Image from Repository.
    # replace username/repo:tag with your name and image details
    image: username/repo:tag 
    # Command used to deploy the Service
    deploy:
      # Run 5 instances of that image as a service called web
      replicas: 5
      resources:
        # Limiting each one to use, at most, 10% of a single core of CPU time and 50MB of RAM.
        limits:
          cpus: "0.1"
          memory: 50M
      # Immediately restart containers if one fails.     
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    # Map port 4000 on the host to webâ€™s port 80.    
    ports:
      - "4000:80"
    # Define default network  
    networks:
      - webnet
networks:
  webnet:
```

Now lets build the image:
```
