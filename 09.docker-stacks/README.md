## Docker Stack

Stack is a group of interrelated services that share dependencies and can be orchestrated and scaled together. A single stack is capable of defining and coordinating the functionality of an entire application. And there could be complex application which might have multiple stacks as well.

Docker Stack uses Compose's YAML format and complements the swarm-specific properties for service deployments.
